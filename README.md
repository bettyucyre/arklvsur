<p>Getting banned from ARK Survival can be a real dinosaur-sized headache, especially if you think it happened by mistake. Don’t worry! This simple guide will walk you through what to do if you’ve been banned and how to appeal so you can get back to taming, building, and surviving in no time.</p>
<h2 id="maybe-you-are-hwid-banned-">Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️</h2>
<p>Did your ban follow you across brand new Ark accounts, or did you get flagged instantly after starting fresh? You might be <strong>HWID banned</strong> (Hardware ID Ban)! This means ARK flagged your PC hardware, making it impossible to play on any new accounts without fixing this first.</p>
