# How to Get Unbanned on ARK Survival (2025 Guide) 🦖

Getting banned from ARK Survival can be a real dinosaur-sized headache, especially if you think it happened by mistake. Don’t worry! This simple guide will walk you through what to do if you’ve been banned and how to appeal so you can get back to taming, building, and surviving in no time.

## Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️

Did your ban follow you across brand new Ark accounts, or did you get flagged instantly after starting fresh? You might be **HWID banned** (Hardware ID Ban)! This means ARK flagged your PC hardware, making it impossible to play on any new accounts without fixing this first.

## Step 1: Understand Why You Were Banned ❓

Check any emails or messages from ARK Survival or its platform (Steam, Epic, etc.) to figure out the ban reason. Common triggers include:
- Using mods or cheats that break server rules  
- Toxic or abusive behavior toward other players  
- Sharing accounts or suspicious account activity  

**Tip:** Always review the ARK Survival Terms of Service before appealing — it helps you stay on the right side of the dinos.

## Step 2: Collect Your Information 📝

- Your ARK account username or Epic/Steam ID  
- The email linked to your account  
- The date and time the ban happened  
- Any screenshots or error messages received

## Step 3: Submit a Ban Appeal 📧

Head over to the ARK support or platform help page where you can send an appeal. For Steam users, use Steam Support; for Epic accounts, use Epic Games support. Here’s a handy appeal template for your message:

> **Subject:** ARK Survival Ban Appeal - [Your Username]  
>  
> Dear ARK Support Team,  
>  
> I recently received a ban on my ARK Survival account ([Your Username] / [Email Address]) on [Date]. I believe this ban was made in error and kindly request a detailed review of my case.  
>  
> I have always aimed to follow the rules and have not used any cheats or engaged in behavior violating the ARK Survival Terms of Service. Please let me know if you need any further information from me.  
>  
> Thank you for your time and assistance.  
>
